	Things to Check:
		- Change in build orders, do people buy less Doran's Rings since the items have had cost and recipe reductions.
		- Check frequency of items bought, what is purchased more now?
		- Build orders, check items around spikes and see if the order changes, do people buy Rylai's more as a 2-3 item now than a 4-6?
		- Double AP comps, with the item changes, are there more 2 AP champion compositions in games?
		- For each changed item (Fully built, not components), find the champion who buys it most and show how often that champion is played.
		- Any other ideas on demonstrating differences in item changes should be displayed.
